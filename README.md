### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass - For Styles
- Visual studio code
- Media Queries for Mobile view

### What I learned

This is my first project using Sass. I learned how to create multiple .scss files and get the single css file. I used visual studio code's sass compiler extension to compile it.  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```Sass

$variable-name: value;
 
.class-name {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
 
### Continued development

In future, I will be using Sass more often, as this project is quite simple so I couldn't apply many functionalities.
